          <h2 id="title">Advertising & Graphic Design Student.</h2>
          <p id="statement">I remember growing up and being able to freely explore the world around me. Outside was my safe haven, somewhere I could escape and be free from the restrictions of the world and behold the earth’s wonders. The way in which our surrounding environment shapes us intrigues me. I’m interested in exploring the realm of Environmental/Experiential Graphic Design and shaping the human experience of spaces through creative storytelling. </p>
